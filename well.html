                        <br><h2>What is Wellness?</h2>
                        <p>
                            <br>Wellness is the act of practicing healthy habits on a daily basis to attain better physical and mental health outcomes, so that instead of just surviving, you’re thriving. <br>
                            <br>
                            <br>To understand the significance of wellness, it’s important to understand how it's linked to health. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), health is defined as being “a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.” <br>
                            <br>Several key areas of your lifestyle are considered dimensions of overall Wellness. They include: social connectedness, exercise, nutrition, sleep and mindfulness. Each one has an impact on your physical and mental health. By making simple and healthy choices on a daily basis, you will be well on your way towards reducing stress, having positive social interactions and achieving optimal wellness. <br>
                            <br>Start with small changes within each dimension and take it one day at a time – you don’t have to run a marathon or go on a restrictive diet to implement wellness into your everyday life! Some of the examples of these dimensions are: Exercise, sound sleep, meditation, mindfulness, proper nutrients in diet and so on.<br>

                        <h2>Meditation</h2>
                        <p>
                            <br> Meditation has been practiced for thousands of years. Meditation originally was meant to help deepen understanding of the sacred and mystical forces of life. These days, meditation is commonly used for relaxation and stress reduction. <br>
                            <br>Meditation is considered a type of mind-body complementary medicine. Meditation can produce a deep state of relaxation and a tranquil mind. <br>
                            <br>During meditation, you focus your attention and eliminate the stream of jumbled thoughts that may be crowding your mind and causing stress. This process may result in enhanced physical and emotional well-being. <br>

                                    Meditation might also be useful if you have a medical condition, especially one that may be worsened by stress. <br>
                                    <br>While a growing body of scientific research supports the health benefits of meditation, some researchers believe it's not yet possible to draw conclusions about the possible benefits of meditation. <br>
                                    <br>With that in mind, some research suggests that meditation may help people manage symptoms of conditions such as: <br>

                                    Be sure to talk to your health care provider about the pros and cons of using meditation if you have any of these conditions or other health problems. In some rare cases, meditation might worsen symptoms associated with certain mental health conditions. <br>
                                    <br>Meditation isn't a replacement for traditional medical treatment. But it may be a useful addition to your other treatment. <br>
