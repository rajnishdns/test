        <h2>Physical Exercise</h2>
        <p>
            WHO defines physical activity as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure. 
            Physical activity refers to all movement including during leisure time, for transport to get to and from places, or as part
             of a person’s work. Both moderate- and vigorous-intensity physical activity improve health. <br>
             <br>Popular ways to be active include walking, cycling, wheeling, sports, active recreation and play, and can be done at
              any level of skill and for enjoyment by everybody. Regular physical activity is proven to help prevent and manage noncommunicable
              diseases such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and several
              cancers. It also helps prevent hypertension, maintain healthy body weight and can improve mental health,
               quality of life and well-being.  <br>

        <br><h2>Benifits of physical activity</h2>
        <p>
            Regular physical activity, such as walking, cycling, wheeling, doing sports or active recreation, provides significant benefits for health. Some physical activity is better than doing none. By becoming more active throughout the day in relatively simple ways, people can easily achieve the recommended activity levels.  <br>
            <br>Physical inactivity is one of the leading risk factors for noncommunicable diseases mortality. People who are insufficiently active have a 20% to 30% increased risk of death compared to people who are sufficiently active. <br>
            <br>Regular physical activity can: <br>
            <ul type="disc">
                <li>improve muscular and cardiorespiratory fitness;</li>
                <li>improve bone and functional health;</li>
                <li>reduce the risk of hypertension, coronary heart disease, <br>stroke, diabetes, various types of cancer (including breast <br> cancer and colon cancer), and depression;</li>
                <li>reduce the risk of falls as well as hip or vertebral fractures; <br> and</li>
                <li>help maintain a healthy body weight.</li>

        <br><h2>How to increase physical activity?</h2>
        <p>
            Countries and communities must take action to provide everyone with more opportunities to be active, in order to increase physical activity. This requires a collective effort, both national and local, across different sectors and disciplines to implement policy and solutions appropriate to a country’s cultural and social environment to promote, enable and encourage physical activity. <br>
            <br>Policies to increase physical activity aim to ensure that: <br>
            <ul type="disc">
                <li>walking, cycling and other forms of active non-motorized forms of transport are accessible and safe for all;</li>
                <li>labour and workplace policies encourage active commuting and opportunities for being physically active during the work day;</li>
                <li>childcare, schools and higher education institutions provide supportive and safe spaces and facilities for all students to spend their free time actively;</li>
                <li>primary and secondary schools provide quality physical education that supports children to develop behaviour patterns that will keep them physically active throughout their lives; </li>
                <li>community-based and school-sport programmes provide appropriate opportunities for all ages and abilities;</li>
                <li>sports and recreation facilities provide opportunities for everyone to access and participate in a variety of different sports, dance, exercise and active recreation; and</li>
                <li>health care providers advise and support patients to be regularly active.</li>
